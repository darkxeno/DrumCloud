AUTOMATOR MODE - [NEW 1.1.0]
===========================

Creative multitouch sampler mode. Controls available:

- Main working mode menu [ON RELEASE]
- 4 animated rotatory knobs
- 2 submenus, one to select the current modified parameter and one to stop each of the samples.
- 4 click-drag zones, one for each sample type

Main working schemes: HOLD and STOP. When on HOLD mode the samples doesn't get stopped when you release the touch on the click-drag zones, on the contrary the STOP mode needs one or more fingers pressed on the click zones to get sound.

The 4 rotatory knobs control the repetition loop amount of each sample type (update when you touch again the corresponding touch zone). The LOOP submenu option changes automatically the value of this knobs when you drag up and down on the click zones.

The parameter submenu has the following options available: [ VOLUME | SAMPLE | LOOP | PITCH ] all of these are totally self-explanatory.

The delete submenu allows you to remove the selected sound type to a . It's only available on the HOLD mode.

The 4 click-drag zones are the main core the Automator mode. They are "multi-dragable" to allow you to modify 2, 3 or 4 parameters at the same time. Try all the modes combinations to find your prefered one.

Hint: to get better touch screen response try to avoid the interference caused by the near finger contact.
