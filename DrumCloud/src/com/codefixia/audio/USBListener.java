	 * This is a workaround for the inconvenient way Android implements device attachment
	 * notification. It is not currently possible to set up notification listeners in code
	 * alone. Instead you need to explicitely have the system start some activity, that 
	 * needs to be declared in the application's AndroidManifest.xml file along with
	 * intent filters and metadata, see AndroidManifest.xml and res/xml/devices.xml.
	 * The sideeffect of this is that given your app is running while an interface is
	 * attached, Android will terminate and relaunch it, so it may be easier to not make use 
	 * of this (in fact it is outcommented in the manifest). nmj will detect USB interfaces 
	 * during normal launch without it.
